<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you're a woman (or any other underrepresented group) in tech, you <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/lara-hogan/2015-may-18">count the minutes</a> from when a conversation starts to being asked how you feel about women in tech. Typically, this is followed by either an argument, or a request for education.</p>

This is exhausting. For the person asking, this is a new conversation. For you, it's the thousandth time explaining the same points (and inevitably refuting the same disagreements).

I'm glad people want to learn. So, these days, I point them to a [list of resources I've collected](https://pinboard.in/u:natdudley/t:101/) and invite them to start their learning there. I'm happy to answer questions after that.
