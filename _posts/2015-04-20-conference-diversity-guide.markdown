Organising a conference is a stressful thing. You want the best event possible, and sometimes it's hard to know exactly what to do to make your event awesome and inclusive to as many people as possible. I've [prepared a guide](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/) to help New Zealand conference organisers make their events better.

If you need more help, [ping me](http://natdudley.github.io/contact).
