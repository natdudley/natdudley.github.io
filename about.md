	<p class="intro">Hi, I'm Nat.</p>
I'm a UX and Comms designer from Auckland, New Zealand. I work for a growing software startup, and help other software companies out with their UX and comms design problems.

I also help conferences and companies with their diversity problems. 

I don't profess to be an expert on these things, or indeed anything.

A lot of my time is spend turning string into fabric with my hands. It gives you time to think about the world.
