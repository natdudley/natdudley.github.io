<div class="post">
	<p class="intro">Hi, I'm Nat.</p>
	<p>I'm a UX and Comms designer from Auckland, New Zealand. I work for a growing software startup, and help other software companies out with their UX and comms design problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://conference.hopper.org.nz">I also help conferences and companies with their diversity problems.</a></p> 

<p>I don't profess to be an expert on these things, or indeed anything.</p>

<p>A lot of my time is spent turning string into fabric with my hands. It gives you time to think about the world.</p>
